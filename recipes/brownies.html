        <ol> 
            <li>Chop butter into small cubes and add to a bowl. Also add dark chocolate broken down into pieces</li>
            <li>Fill a saucepan with water and boil over a low heat. Sit the butter/chocolate bowl on top of the pan and keep over heat until fully melted.</li>
            <li>Remove bowl and leave to cool</li>
            <li>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.</li>
            <li>Sieve the plain flour and cocoa powder into a separate bowl and then chop the remaining chocolate into small chunks.</li>
            <li>Add eggs and caster sugar into another bowl and whisk until thick and creamy - check for a trail if unsure.</li>
            <li>Fold the melted chocolate into the egg mixture until completely mixed and just a dark brown colour. After this add the cocoa and flour mix and fold in until no longer dusty and looks sticky and fudgy. Then stir in chocolate chunks.</li>
            <li>Pour mixture into a greased tin and cover base completely, making sure mixture is levelled out evenly.</li>
            <li>Bake for 30 mins, add any extra time needed until its shiny, crisp and baked through.</li>
            <li>Leave to cool.</li>
        </ol>
