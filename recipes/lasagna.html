    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <div class="list">
        <ol> 
            <li>To make the meat sauce, put the oil, onion, carrot, garlic and pancetta in a large saucepan. On a medium high heat, cook until the veg is soft and golden.</li>
            <li>Add the beef and pork mince, the milk and chopped tomatoes and stir together making sure to break up any lumps of mince. After 5 - 10 minutes stir in the oregano, the stock cubes and the red wine, and bring to a simmer. Cover and cook for 45 minutes. Stir occasionally.</li>
            <li>Uncover and continue to simmer until the meat is tender and saucy.</li>
            <li>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Layer the base of an oven proof dish with some of the meat sauce. Cover with a layer of dried pasta sheets, snapping them to fit if needed. Cover this completely with a quarter of the bechamel sauce. Then add a layer of the meat sauce and sprinkle over some of the parmesan.</li>
            <li>Repeat the above step twice more and add a final layer of pasta.</li>
            <li>Finally cover pasta sheets completely with the last of the bechamel and sprinkle on remaining parmesan. Bake for a further 45 minutes browned and crisp on top.</li>
        </ol>
